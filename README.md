# challenge-dataone
The program takes a csv file, and a list of products that someone wants to buy, and outputs the shop they should go to, and the total price it will cost them. It is okay to purchase extra products, as long as the total cost is minimized. The program assumes that the customer wants to buy all the products from a single shop.

Shop IDs are integers, all products are lower case letters and underscores, and the price is a decimal number.

Sample Data set:
